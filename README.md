objective:This project, titled "Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)". The objective of this task is to analyze the sentiment behind textual data—typically user reviews, tweets, or social media posts—and classify each piece of text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a key area in Natural Language Processing and is widely used in areas such as customer feedback analysis, product reviews, political opinion monitoring, and social media content understanding. For this task, we used Python and implemented the code in Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook platform that eliminates the need for software installation and provides built-in access to GPUs and necessary libraries. The dataset chosen for this project is the IMDb Movie Review Dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle and contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either positive or negative. We downloaded this dataset using the Kaggle API directly into the Colab environmentThe entire workflow of this project follows a typical machine learning pipeline. We began by loading the dataset and performing data cleaning and preprocessing. Preprocessing steps included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and HTML tags, tokenizing the text, removing stopwords, and applying lemmatization to reduce words to their base form. These steps are crucial to ensure that the model focuses only on the most meaningful parts of the text. After cleaning the text data, we used TF-IDF Vectorizer and Bag-of-Words models to convert the text into numerical feature vectors, which are required for machine learning algorithms to function. Next, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. We then trained several machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). After training, we evaluated the models using standard classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and used a confusion matrix to analyze the performance visually. Among the models tested, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes gave the most consistent and reliable results, achieving accuracy scores above 85%.We also visualized the data using word clouds, bar charts, and class distribution plots to better understand the most common words in positive and negative reviews and the balance of the dataset. Additionally, we discussed options for deploying the model using Python web frameworks such as Flask or Streamlit, although deployment was optional for this task. This project demonstrates not only technical proficiency in NLP and machine learning but also the ability to manage an end-to-end data science workflow: from dataset acquisition to model evaluation. It shows how combining data cleaning, feature extraction, model selection, and result visualization can lead to actionable insights from unstructured text data. In conclusion, this sentiment analysis project fulfills the requirements of Task-4 by implementing core NLP concepts and machine learning techniques in a clean and reproducible way using Google Colab. It can be extended further by using deep learning models such as LSTM or transformers, or even deployed as a web-based sentiment prediction tool for real-time use cases. This work reflects a practical understanding of text analytics and its applications in solving real-world problems.
